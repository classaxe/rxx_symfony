NDB LIST AWARD REQUEST
(Reference: {{ url }})

Dear {{ admin }},

I would like to request the following awards, based upon my published logs in {{ system|upper }}.
I confirm that have not previously received these awards.

{% for award in awards %}
* {{ award|split('-')[0] }}{% if award|split('-')[1] is defined %} ({{ award|split('-')[1] }}){% endif %}

{% endfor %}

Sincerely,

{{ name|raw }}
