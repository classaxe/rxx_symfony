    <p>{% trans %}This service is offered <strong>guilt-free</strong> and without any form of advertising as a gift to those who enjoy the hobby (art?) of NDB Listening.{% endtrans %}</p>
    <p>{% trans %}I am incredibly grateful to our <a href="#footer">site administrators</a> who give their time at great personal cost but at no charge to the community, and to the listeners who provide their logs for inclusion.{% endtrans %}<br/>
       {% trans %}Without those contributions this system would not be able to continue operating.{% endtrans %}</p>
    <p>{% trans %}However, for the developer of this system there are additional financial costs to bear in terms of website hosting and domain registration.{% endtrans %}</p>
