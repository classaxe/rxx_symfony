TODO:
1) Take repositories that do not deal with database entities and make them services - e.g. lat / lon conversions
2) Use Event Subscriber to handle authentication for restricted admin modes
3) Move code to Symfony 5.2 framework - allegedly 7% faster - apparently an upgrade path is possible.
4) Use DAO - Data access object for classes such as 'Paper' that have no DB entity representations
5) Implement preservation of map options when switching between modes in signals list
6) Create cron job to complete processing of stalled large log sessions
